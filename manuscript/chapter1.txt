### Theme Song — The Essence of Darkness

Essence find your way only to your dwelling place in
the deep dark place well lit. Have you found the way
there yet?


## Unknown


Searching for me, that is me. In me dwelling in joy At the center
settled and full of peace, love and calm. The place of connection,
unknown by location. Not finding it, yet able to dwell perfectly
in it, be it. In a sense, like the wind unknown in origin, felt very
surely, and I would not think, to overthink any idea of the darkness.
When a glimmer of brightness displays it’s path to the unknown,
we have arrived in the first place, called me finding me, the unity
of the inner, with the expression of the outer, the earlier sense that
It looks like tonight. Will be a challenge getting to sleep, thinking
of the day yet to dawn?


Awake I see in nothing I am oriented in no specific direction,
I go forward to me welcomed and loved, fully me, I am unsure
if there was a road that the essence followed no question that is
knows its dwelling in concert the spin of the Earth and the dance
with the Moon’s tides, his longing is certain oh to be the one in one
perfectly formed together without disconnect now known are the
infinite rivers of water, the sowing up good produces in the right
season.


## Where Did I Come From?


One would expect a non-question makes no sense should I understand origins
is there a coordinate, a physical plane of dwelling in the three-spectral of
being (spirit, soul, body) as the spirit, one has
connection to the divine. The soul with its non-id, the me that is
me the body as container maybe I know where the place beyond
places. The space within space and constrained by time and space
or perhaps beyond all, nothing and nowhere I don’t know.


## Enter the Darkness


The strongest day becomes the night of unknown ways of being.
Normal understanding is not. Places vanish into thin air. Unclean
swamps pull in those not paying attention to where they step,
plunged into obscurity. The ocean yielding its fresh fish to nourish
the soul of mankind. Butterflies so beautiful and playful have gone
through such an amazing metamorphoses from a caterpillar in a
cocoon. Swarms of them come and kiss the man in line with the
god. The fish leap to catch them for dinner.


One leaves no uncertain way, life’s vibration is seen. Even as
the Biblical Job understood nothing of his place. God speaks over
and over in a way we can understand. In a manner we can see
without seeing. One should hold to places, people, things, ideas
loosely. Wow, so much to define what life is. To arrive in time and
space gives rise to the constraining yet function of that sphere. Is it
up? Is it down? Where is the place? What is the place to dine and
enjoy the popcorn of joy with ghee and spice? To know the bridge
is under construction has no worries to give. Trust is needed. The
the sureness of some weird reality makes one mad. If nothing, then
more of nothing.


Why journey into the dark? I ask myself the question the soul
doesn’t understand. Darkness says it rules, until light comes. A
clean day full of sunshine rules, until dark clouds, rain, wind comes.
The downspout of life is unpredictable. So, then. Where do I live? Is
a fixed place on a map? Dwelling with my Lord means there
is no limit as to where, how, what can be, will be, and the memory
of what was. Again, The definitions and configurations of time and
space determines. Rise to other realizations. Why venture into the
dark? Is it a place called me? Is it hidden of unknowable only by
passing as some form of shadow? I don’t know. It is some-thing,
somewhere, until I see no-thing. The showing of scenery is both
amazing and beautiful. Peace.


## Enter the Darkness


is a dwelling even when there are representations of other things.
So, don’t worry, have peace and illumination. We don’t want to
thing of the beyond as here with a tuning of frequency or change in
perception. Yet with the simple look at things, I find it is new again.
Once I feel a settled ground, the axis has moved. I really want the
unconditional. Looking into the darkness, all things happen with
the light of darkness. Light shines out, causing vanquish darkness.
The push and pull are instant with the speed of light in constant.

## Enter the Light


There are some interactions that will never pass the basis of
understanding. Other moments signify a difference in clarity of
what is known at a deep level. So, then the mind, body and heart are
left to contemplate what is going on at a deep subterranean level.
no longing, nor feeling, yet it is pure energy and knowing. Light
continues to reveal as I enter it. Forgetting all I think I know. Me,
the superficial me, knows nothing.


I assert a distance, then a distance impact with no blockers
ahead. Hoping and knowing it yields an unlimited energy, then
yields a practical purpose. I assert to get out of anything as a holding
pattern, otherwise it eventually becomes a mobius strip of default
and infinity. Yes, then understand entering the light in all areas of
my heart, mind, body, soul and strength provides the road leading
to a new reality and dimension. How easy it is to get stuck in any
form or pattern of recognition in an of life.


When it is night, how the soul longs for the light. Yet the
absence of the dark, immediately gives way to light. The components
and elements of “the light being turned on” is a narrow
path. The well worn paths of thought, walking, talking, behavior
and living require little effort to simple rinse, lather and repeat the
expected expressions and manifestations of such. The inner work,
the challenge is to step back and recognize what is happening,
versus saying, “ok, that’s just how I am”! One is destined only by
choice to stay in the same way of being.


So then, the night gives reflections of the deep self. Unknown to
consciousness. The archetypes of position, place, timing and realizations
of the possible. Being properly prepared is any expression
or the situation is understood. A person has to at some point go beyond
current capabilities. Do something that they have never done. It
is one thing to ride on a ship. Yet something altogether different
when you must pilot it. The proper methods of speaking, embracing
fully the domain driven language of the environment yet able to
address anyone of any stature, position or job. Navigating the inner
sanctum of the heart is challenging, in that, one doesn’t really know
what to expect.


Biblical references speaking word of Jesus declare, it’s not what
is consumed that defiles us, but the things in the heart of mankind
(whatever your favorite issue or conflict with any(one, person,
thing, group)) comes from what lies in the heart. Those ideas are
deep within, coming to use and flowing through us are the patterns
and structures of life, the references universal that bring about a
daily life of sameness. Have you ever stopped and asked. Why do I
repeat yesterday with such vigor? If I only do or see yesterday, then
what do I move toward now, at this moment? Where am I?
Who Am I? Why do I think about things that waste my precious time?
As a creative person, I want to create, help produce, give, dwell and
interact with people of all nations.

## Who Am I


Many scholars, researchers, yogis, monks and spiritual seekers
arrive at a question where I find myself now, that place when I ask.
Who am I really? I’m not my faith, role, experience, social standing,
culture, learned and practiced behavior, successes or failures. Is
the key to me an internal or external locus of control? So many
questions, and not many deep answers. From the cradle to
now, my life has been the seemingly random series or happenings
and events. No matter who has come and departed my world, I see
the same streets, writings, videos indicating the world simply goes
on as it has before I came here. And my assumption is after I leave,
family and friends will grieve and make the best effort to continue
life, not knowing their end.


I can recall vacations, fun times, disagreements, birthdays,
parties and all kinds of fun and enlightening experiences. Yet the
the brevity of it all comes to the forefront of my mind. Truth is, I
don’t know exactly who I am. My religious and faith background
suggests that I am a spiritual being, living in a physical body with a
personality, a soul. There are other experiential ideas and verbiage
given from major ways of life, the atman from the Sanskrit word
(Atman, …… (WikiDot)) that refers to the self in Hinduism
(Britanica.com/topic/atman). The point then is I speak mostly of
what I experience right now or something I may or vaguely recall
depending on how meaningful it was to me.


*Perhaps one of my songs/poems describes the feeling well*


> NOTHING

> What do I want
> Do you have it to give
> Looking everywhere only to find nothing new
> Today I’ll look again just in case things change
> All the same faces show up in different places
> Now I see nothing left to see
> Now I hear nothing left to
> Hear, empty and full the universe has it’s pull to nothing
> Nothing to taste it is all the same flavor When I touch
> you I only feel myself.
